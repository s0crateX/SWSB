  SMART WASTE SORTING BIN - SETUP & USAGE GUIDE
================================================================

WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES
----------------------
An automated waste sorting bin using an ESP32 microcontroller.
It detects waste type using sensors and sorts it into two bins:
  - Paper (biodegradable) → left flap (Servo 1)
  - Plastic (non-biodegradable) → right flap (Servo 2)

It has a web interface you can access from your phone to
switch between automatic and manual mode, and view counters.


HARDWARE YOU NEED
-----------------
1. ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP32 DevKit V1)
2. 2x SG90 servo motors (or similar small servos)
3. 1x Capacitive proximity sensor (digital output)
4. 1x IR obstacle sensor (digital output)
5. 1x Push button (optional, for manual trigger)
6. Jumper wires
7. 5V external power supply for servos (recommended)
8. USB cable (micro-USB or USB-C depending on your ESP32)


WIRING DIAGRAM
--------------
  ESP32 Pin    -->  Component
  ---------         ---------
  GPIO 21     -->   Capacitive sensor OUT (detects plastic)
  GPIO 19     -->   IR sensor OUT (detects paper)
  GPIO 4      -->   Push button (one side, other side to GND)
  GPIO 13     -->   Servo 1 signal wire (paper flap)
  GPIO 14     -->   Servo 2 signal wire (plastic flap)
  3.3V        -->   Sensor VCC pins
  GND         -->   All GND connections

  IMPORTANT FOR SERVOS:
  - Do NOT power servos from ESP32's 3.3V pin (not enough current)
  - Use a separate 5V power supply for both servos
  - Connect the servo power supply GND to ESP32 GND (common ground)
  - Only connect the signal wire (usually orange/yellow) to ESP32


HOW TO USE IT
-------------

1. Power on the ESP32 (via USB or external power)

2. On your phone or laptop, look for WiFi network:
   Name: SmartBin
   Password: smartbin123

3. Connect to that WiFi network

4. Open a web browser and go to:
   http://192.168.4.1

5. You will see the Smart Bin Control page with:
   - Current mode (Manual or Automatic)
   - Buttons to switch modes
   - A "Sort Item" button for manual web-based sorting
   - Counters for biodegradable and non-biodegradable items

MANUAL MODE:
  - Place item in the bin opening
  - Press the physical button OR tap "Sort Item" on the web page
  - The sensors read the item and the correct flap opens

AUTOMATIC MODE:
  - Tap "Automatic Mode" on the web page
  - The bin continuously monitors the sensors
  - When an item is detected, it sorts automatically
  - 2-second delay between sorts to prevent double-counting


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: Servos don't move
  -> Check wiring, especially signal pins (GPIO 13 and 14)
  -> Use separate 5V power for servos, not ESP32's 3.3V
  -> Check servo angles in code (servo1Home, servo1Left, etc.)

Problem: Can't find "SmartBin" WiFi
  -> Make sure ESP32 is powered and the code uploaded successfully
  -> Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to see status messages
  -> Try resetting the ESP32 (press EN/RST button)

Problem: Sensors always detect / never detect
  -> Check sensor wiring and power
  -> Open Serial Monitor to see CAP and IR values
  -> Adjust sensor sensitivity potentiometer (small screw on sensor)
  -> Capacitive sensor: LOW = detected, HIGH = nothing
  -> IR sensor: 0 = detected, 1 = nothing

Problem: Wrong bin for item type
  -> Swap sensor positions or swap pin numbers in code
  -> Adjust servo angles (servo1Home, servo1Left, servo2Home, servo2Right)

Problem: Upload fails
  -> Hold BOOT button during upload
  -> Try a different USB cable (some are charge-only)
  -> Check that correct COM port is selected
  -> Install CP210x or CH340 USB driver for your ESP32


CALIBRATING SERVO ANGLES
-------------------------
The servo angles may need adjusting for your physical bin:
  - servo1Home = 0    (paper flap closed position)
  - servo1Left = 90   (paper flap open position)
  - servo2Home = 90   (plastic flap closed position)
  - servo2Right = 180  (plastic flap open position)

Change these values at the top of IKADUHA.ino to match
your bin's physical design. Upload again after changing.


SENSOR LOGIC
------------
  Capacitive sensor LOW  = plastic/metal detected  -> right bin
  IR sensor reading 0    = paper detected           -> left bin
  Neither sensor active  = nothing detected         -> no action
